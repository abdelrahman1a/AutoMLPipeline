# Auto ML Pipeline with Product Recommendation and PowerBI Dashboard

## Overview
This project is an end-to-end Auto ML Pipeline designed to automate exploratory data analysis (EDA), data cleaning, and machine learning model selection and training using **PyCaret** for classification, regression, or clustering tasks. 

Additionally, it includes a **Product Recommendation System** based on collaborative filtering, trained on an e-commerce dataset, and a **PowerBI Dashboard** integrated with SQL Server queries for data visualization and insights.

The pipeline allows users to:
- Input a CSV dataset
- Generate an automated EDA report
- Download a cleaned dataset
- Export trained machine learning models as `.pkl` files

## Features

- **Automated EDA Report**: Generates a comprehensive profiling report for any input CSV dataset, summarizing key statistics, distributions, and insights.
- **Data Cleaning**: Automatically preprocesses and cleans the dataset, handling missing values, outliers, and data type issues.
- **Machine Learning Automation**: Uses PyCaret to automatically detect the problem type (classification, regression, or clustering) and trains the best-performing model.
- **Model and Data Export**: Allows downloading the trained model as a `.pkl` file and the cleaned dataset as a CSV.
- **Product Recommendation System**: Implements collaborative filtering to recommend products based on user behavior, trained on an e-commerce dataset.
- **PowerBI Dashboard**: Visualizes data insights using PowerBI, powered by SQL Server queries for dynamic data retrieval and analysis.
